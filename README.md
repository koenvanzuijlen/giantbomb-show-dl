## Features

### Highest quality

Will always download the highest quality available for each video. Normally the API does not return 8k bitrate versions of videos. but this tool checks if they are available and downloads them when the quality `highest` is used.

### Download tracking

Will keep track of which files are downloaded successfully. These files will not be downloaded again on the next run, this provides an easy way to retry failed downloads by re-running the same command.

To reset download tracking remove the `downloaded.json` file from the relative directory.

### Save images and metadata

This tool also downloads the image(s) and metadata for each show and video. This data can be used to enhance your library in your media server of choice.

### Rate limiting

This tool will autmatically rate limit API requests to not exceed Giant Bomb API usage guidelines.
